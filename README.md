# WimStudy

WimStudy is a revolutionary study aid that provides creative and easily accessible tools to the user.
Designed to maintain focus, set attainable goals, designate time towards specifc taks, and organize various commitments.

The format will seek to provide the user with a dashboard that will cater to the needs of a specifc student, 
their engagements, their productivity levels etc. by collecting data upon each entry. When opened, WimStudy
will inquire as to how much time is available and which task category the user would like to tackle. It will then 
recommend a timer feature and highlight a task. This entry can also be opted out of by the user to allow for a
freestyle study approach, in addition to several fairly open-ended timer options. 

The dashboard will include a timer and a task list. The timer is manipulated by the chosen format, but can 
also be set to the user's desired intervals under a selectable setting. There will be several recommended settings 
that will cater towards the needs and productiveity levels of the user. The task list will contain the various tasks
that need to be accomplished. The items will need to be entered by the user and can include a description, a due date
and be categorized. The schedule will include the items on the task list that contain a due date and any other events 
that the user wants to enter. The schedule aims to be visuallyappealing and easy to observe. 

# Needed Contributions

- Any GUI help to make the dashboard more appealing
  - Currently operates through just text output
- Creating a function that can accomodate the timer inputs
  - Will most likely need to individually code the options
- Helping to improve the Syntax of python code to allow for bug free runs
